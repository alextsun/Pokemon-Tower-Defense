This is a 3D Pokemon Tower Defense game I wrote with a partner during a 3-week Game Development course using JS, Unity, and Maya at UC San Diego.  No code is in this repo.  To play this game, download everything in this repo except this README.md (INCLUDING THE FOLDER).   Then click the application, and choose 1200x800 for pixel size.  To play, click on towers in the top left and click the map to place them.  You can click "side view" to see a 3D view, and "top view" to see a flat view.
